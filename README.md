## Troubleshooting section
1. Wordpress issues when running Docker
    - Check if Apache is running because of WAMP or any other apache software bundle
        - open localhost:80 or whatever
    - Check if the ports are correctly configured in the docker-compose.yaml file 

2. Cannot connect to mysql database
    - DO NOT SET UP WORDPRESS until confirmed!
